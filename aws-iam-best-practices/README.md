**IAM best practices for API serverless AWS application:**

For an API serverless AWS application, effectively designing the IAM roles and policies is a crucial job in terms of scalability, manageability and security. Here I am drafting some best practices and considerations which can help us decide, how to create IAM roles and policies for a serverless AWS cloud-native application.

**IAM guidelines and best practices:**

**1. Least Privilege Principle:**

The concept of least privilege states that you should only allow rights that are required for each component or service to carry out its necessary functions. Do not assign your positions overly lenient policies. Start with the fewest possible permissions and gradually increase them as necessary.

**2. Role distinction:**

We might want to consider defining distinct IAM roles for certain parts or features of our serverless service. Like API Gateway, Lambda functions, and any other AWS services which our application uses can all have unique responsibilities, for instance. In the event of a security breach, this division helps to decrease the blast radius and isolate permissions.

**3. Service-Scoped Roles:**

Use service-specific roles for AWS services that demand access to certain resources. If Lambda functions, for instance, require access to S3 buckets, build a different role with S3 permissions policies and apply it to your Lambda functions. This guarantees that each service only has the permissions that are necessary.

**4. Managed Policies:**

Whenever possible, use AWS-managed policies. AWS offers a selection of managed preconfigured rules that address typical use cases, such as read-only access to particular services. Because AWS is responsible for maintaining and updating these policies, you have less maintenance work to do.

**5. Roles for Lambda Execution:**

Create distinct IAM roles for your Lambda functions according to their unique requirements. Roles for Lambda Execution. This lessens the likelihood that a compromised Lambda function will abuse its permissions in the "privilege escalation" scenario. For common Lambda execution rights, use the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole managed policy as a starting point.

**6. Cross-Account Access:**

Use IAM roles with cross-account trust relationships if your serverless application requires cross-account access (for example, a Lambda function in one AWS account accessing resources in another account). Sharing access credentials or keys is less necessary as a result.

**7. Least Scope for API Gateway:**

Make sure we only grant the permissions required for the API to communicate with other AWS services when defining an IAM role for API Gateway. To prevent unauthorized access, restrict access rights to only certain API operations and resources.

**8. Policies with Conditions:**

Utilise conditional measures to increase security. Restrictions can be put into effect by conditional policies based on factors like IP address, time of day, or user agent.

**9. Iteration and testing:**

Before deploying your IAM roles and policies to production, thoroughly test them. In order to check for unauthorized permissions, analyze policies using AWS Identity and Access Management Analyzer. As you obtain a deeper grasp of the demands of your application, iterate and improve your roles and policies.

**10. Documentation and auditing:**

Keep track of our IAM roles, policies, and the justifications for the permissions they grant. Make sure our IAM configurations consistently reflect the requirements of our application and security best practices by reviewing and auditing them.
