## POC: Allow only the traffic coming via a CloudFront

</br>We can develop a script using the Python v3 to get the ip-ranges of CloudFront
There is library called boto3 helps to retrieve the current list of CloudFront IP ranges

</br>AWS provides all ip-ranges in json with below the URL:
</br>https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json
